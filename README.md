### Functional-and-Data-Driven-GDP-Analysis

A fully functional, data-driven GDP analysis system built using functional programming principles, with a strong emphasis on modularity, composability, and configuration-driven analysis. The project is implemented in Python, leveraging multiple data and analysis libraries, and includes clear visualizations produced using Matplotlib to make economic trends easier to reason about.

Created by Muhammad Moosa and Syed Abdullah — two dinguses with a questionable sense of humor but a solid knack for computers and data.
